# Student Data Score Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes student data and exam scores using Python.  
The goal of this project is to explore patterns in performance, understand the impact of different factors on scores, and generate useful visualizations and insights.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `Student Data Score analysis.ipynb` – Main notebook with data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- `data/` – (Optional) Folder containing the dataset(s).
  - `student_scores.csv` – Example dataset with student-related information.
- `requirements.txt` – List of Python libraries used in this project.

## 📊 Dataset

You can use any student score dataset with columns such as:

- `Student_ID`
- `Name`
- `Gender`
- `Age`
- `Study_Hours`
- `Attendance`
- `Internal_Marks`
- `External_Marks`
- `Total_Score`
- `Grade`

> 🔹 Make sure to update the notebook and this README if your column names are different.

## 🧪 Analysis Performed

The notebook includes (or can include):

- Data loading and initial exploration
- Handling missing values and data cleaning
- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.)
- Visualizations:
  - Score distribution
  - Relationship between study hours and scores
  - Comparison of performance across different groups (e.g., gender, attendance levels)
- Correlation analysis between features (e.g., study hours vs total score)
- Simple predictive analysis (optional) – e.g., using linear regression to predict scores

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn` (optional, if you perform ML)

## ▶️ How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/student-data-score-analysis.git
   cd student-data-score-analysis




pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
Open Student Data Score analysis.ipynb and run the cells.
